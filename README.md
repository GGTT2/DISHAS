# DISHAS

Digital humanities transform the availability of historical sources gradually, along with the means to analyse, edit, and relate them. 
These changes should be addressed, anticipated, and fostered by various research communities in history. 
DISHAS (Digital Information System for the History of Astral Sciences) is a collective enterprise supported by the CHAMA (Commission for the History of Ancient and Medieval Astronomy) that addresses changes in the field of the history of astral sciences. 
DISHAS relies on a network of international projects in Chinese, Sanskrit, Arabic, Latin and Hebrew sources.
In the long run, it aims, in collaboration with partner projects, at providing tools to the community to edit and analyse the different types of sources usually treated in the history of astral sciences, namely, scientific instruments, prose and versified texts, iconography and technical/geometrical diagrams, and astronomical tables. 
As a pilot attempt, DISHAS focuses on astronomical tables.
