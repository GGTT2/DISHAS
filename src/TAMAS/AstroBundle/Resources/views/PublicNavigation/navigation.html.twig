                The website has been designed to adapt to the needs and interests of a variety of users, comprised of
                researchers in the history of astronomy as well as an interested non-expert audience. Because some users
                may wish to browse through the corpus while others may seek specific resources, different ways have been
                developed to access the data. To find a particular document, the search engine offers advanced ways of
                searching the corpus. To browse more freely, the navigation pages invite you to explore topics of
                interest using interactive visualizations. Several principles have guided the design of the interface:

                    <th>
                        <h3>Accessibility</h3>

                            By weaving links between records, related data are made accessible from every node of the
                            network. Thus, it is possible to reconstruct multiple contexts from which the data finds its
                            meaning. Visualizations help to make visible the interactions between the data. Whether
                            through the search page, the navigation pages or the API, the focus is always on the ease of
                            access to the information.

                            The concepts and objects of study in the history of astronomy are complex, and thus the
                            approach to sources adopted by DISHAS needs to be made explicit. This is why an effort has
                            been made to render the content of the platform as intelligible as possible. Several
                            comprehension support tools have been deployed. In particular, the DISHAS platform offers
                            numerous visualizations, documentation pages, and visual supports.

                            Finally, the DISHAS platform seeks to promote and support the analysis of the digital corpus
                            by providing tools to manipulate the data using software tools such as DTI and DIPS. Other
                            devices, like graphical visualizations, allow the user to link contextual data in ways that
                            may reveal unexpected correlations or irregularities in the sources.
