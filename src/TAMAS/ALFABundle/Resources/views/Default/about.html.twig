        <i>ALFA</i> is an ERC funded research project dedicated to the study
        of Alfonsine astronomy which flourished in Europe from the second
        half of 13th century to the middle of the 16th century.

        Alfonsine astronomy is arguably among the first European scientific
        achievements. It shaped a scene for actors like Regiomontanus or
        Copernicus. There is however little detailed historical analysis
        encompassing its development in its full breadth. <i>ALFA</i> addresses this
        issue by studying tables, instruments, mathematical and theoretical
        texts in a methodologically innovative way relying on approaches from
        the history of manuscript cultures, history of mathematics, and
        history of astronomy. <i>ALFA</i> integrates these approaches not only to
        benefit from different perspectives but also to build new questions
        from their interactions. For instance the analysis of mathematical
        practices in astral sciences manuscripts induces new ways to analyse
        the documents and to think about astronomical questions. Relying on
        these approaches the main objectives of <i>ALFA</i> are thus to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Retrace the development of the corpus of Alfonsine texts
            from its origin in the second half of the 13th century to the end
            of the 15th century by following, on the manuscript level, the
            milieus fostering it;
        </li>
        <li>
            Analyse the Alfonsine astronomersâ€™ practices, their relations to mathematics, to the natural
            world, to proofs and justification, their intellectual context and audiences;
        </li>
        <li>
            Build a meaningful narrative showing how astronomers in different milieus with diverse practices
            shaped, also from Arabic materials, an original scientific scene in Europe.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <i>ALFA</i> will shed new light on the intellectual history of the late medieval period as a whole and
        produce a better understanding of its relations to related scientific periods in Europe and beyond.
        It will also produce methodological breakthroughs impacting the ways history of knowledge is
        practiced outside the field of ancient and medieval sciences. Efforts will be devoted to bring these
        results not only to the relevant scholarly communities but also to a wider audience as a resource in
        the public debates around science, knowledge and culture.
